# 16-Second — Usage (Early Scaffold)

## Current state (Milestone 2)
- Basic delay line with Delay Time, Feedback, Mix, and Output Gain.
- Simple record/play loop capture (record once, then play loop).

## Controls
- Delay Time: 0 ms to 16 s.
- Feedback: 0.0 to 1.2.
- Mix: 0 to 1 (dry/wet).
- Output Gain: -24 dB to +12 dB.
- Record: clears buffer and captures a loop while enabled.
- Play: plays the last recorded loop when available.

## Notes
- Loop capture is intentionally minimal and will be refined in later milestones.
